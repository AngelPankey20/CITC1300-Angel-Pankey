      <h1>Rimworld</h1>
      <p>Rimworld is a Si-fi colony management game made by Ludeon Studios and was made by only one guy. There is multiple starts to choose from but the most common start is crash landed. You usually start with 3 colonistS that's randomly picked if you don't have mods installed. There is multiple ways to win depending on which DLC you have. The best experience is if you download mods on PC. Your goal is to help your pawns(colonistS) survive by gathering resources, crafting tools, building shelters, and defending against raiders and the occasionally hostile wildlife. Rimworld difficulty comes from how much wealth you have, the bigger the wealth, the stronger the enemies geimes your wealth gets so high that the game sends you hundreds of half naked tribals, dozens of well armed troops, or a couple of highly deadly mechonoids(robots) after you.</p>
      <h2>Rimworld Main DLCS</h2> 
      <p>There are four main DLCS in Rimworld as of writing of this page which Royalty, Ideology, Biotech, and Anomaly. Each DLC adds big pieces of gameplay to the base game. One of these pieces comes from the Biotech DLC which adds children, genes to pawns, and mechinatiors which allows you to craft and use your own robot while adding defirent mechinoid bosses that you can summon or attack your base when you get too wealthy. Anomaly DLC turns your game into a horror game with Lovecraftian monsters as you try to reasearch how to stop them while also gaining their abilities, but I havn't played much of it. Ideology allows you to create a pawn's religion and you can pick the presets real life religion or create your own. When you create an ideology you gain boost and debuff for example allows you to craft better items at the cost of everything you make take longer to build. Finally there is the royalty DLC which allows you do join the ranks of royality and gain magic powers. The royality DLC was the first Dlc Rimworld created which added specialzed bioncs, mechinoid raids, and magic in a form of meditating at a tree or rising the ranks of royality to get the pyscast implant. </p>
