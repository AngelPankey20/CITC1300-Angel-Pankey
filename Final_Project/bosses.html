          <li><strong>Base Placement:</strong> Keep your base away from boss spawn areas to avoid unnecessary destruction.</li>
          <li><strong>Use the Environment:</strong> Lead bosses into other enemies or natural hazards to weaken them. You can also learn a bosses patterns with trial or error. Or just look up the Wiki or an video if your confused.</li>
          <li><strong>Boss drops:</strong> The majority of Don't Starve Together bosses are optional but you are encouraged to fight them as they drop life changing loot like bundling wraps bluebrints from Beequeen which allows you to hold 4 items in the bundling wrap slot which saves space and can preserve food forever.</li>
